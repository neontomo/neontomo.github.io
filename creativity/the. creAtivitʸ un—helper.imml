        # CONSISTENCY IS FOR ICE CREAM.
        
        WHEN IT MELTS, IT'S NO LONGER FUCKING ICE CREAM.
        
        THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S JUICE. OR SOMETHING.

        THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO STAY CONSISTENT.

        YOU'RE NOT AN ICE CREAM ARE YOU? (rhetorical question)

        GOOD.

        WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE? GO HOME.
        
        <br />

        uh, this is getting... creepy now.
        
        i feel a bit threatened so i'm gonna turn off caps.

        why u still here?

        # THE INSPIRATION STORE

        Hello [insert your name here].

        "When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never..."
        
        no wait.

        that's the wrong quote.

        "Live, Love, Lau..." fuck. that's not it.

        <br />
        
        MARGARETH! WHERE THE HELL ARE THE INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES? I'VE GOT A CUSTOMER!

        ...

        WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU THREW THEM AWAY?

        <br />

        I'm so sorry. We're... out of inspirational quotes.

        I know you're upset, but there's really none left.

        <br />
        Come back later. We'll order some more when the time is right.

        # I believed in myself once!

        It was awful.

        All I could say all day was "I got this bro!"

        People would come to my house to ask me what I'm doing.

        "I got this bro!" came the answer.

        I really **believed** in myself.

        Oh yes, I was a belieber. In myself.
        
        No one could say anything else, because here I was, saying it.

        One time, a friend asked if I could help her pick out a dress for her wedding.

        "I got this bro!"
        
        She stared at me. "So are you coming?"

        She went and picked it without me in the end. Never figured out why.

        # Good marketing is like finding a fish inside your boots.

        Okay, it's nothing like that.
        
        I just wanted to sound like I know what I'm doing.
        
        I've heard that's the key...

        CONFIDENCE.

        Say anything with enough CONFIDENCE and people will believe you.

        I'll prove it to you.

        <br />

        I am completely certain that I'm a loser with nothing to offer the world.

        <br />

        Hehe. Pretty convincing huh? That's the power of CONFIDENCE.

        # AboutAboutAboutAbout WHATABOUT

        Uh. So.

        How do I explain this.

        I'm trying to trick you... into being creative. By uh...

        ...not giving you the right answers. Maybe? Ok yes. FINE, YOU GOT ME.

        <br />

        Right answers-thinking leads to perfectionism and creative blocks.

        **Wrong answers only.**

        Get out of here.
